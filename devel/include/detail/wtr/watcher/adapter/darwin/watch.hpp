        usually receive events in this order:
          1. A rename event on the "from-path"
          2. A rename event on the "to-path"

        up, test it against the current path
        for inequality, and check that it no
        longer exists -- In which case, we can
        say that we were renamed from that path
        to the current path.

        rename events might not be batched, and
        we don't want to trample on some other
        watcher with a static.

/*  Bugs, footguns

    1.
    When we flood the filesystem with events, Darwin may choose,
    for reason I don't fully understand, to tell us about events
    after we are long gone. Maybe the FSEvent stream (which should
    be f'ing closed) sometimes ignores us having asking it to stop.
    Maybe some tasks in the dispatch queue are not being cleared
    properly. I'm not sure.

    Creating events as quickly as possible while a few short-lived
    FSEvents streams are open is usually enough to reproduce this.
    The recipe to reproduce seems to be a ton of filesystem events
    ongoing while some FSEvent streams are open, then closing the
    streams either during or shortly after the events stop happening
    to the filesystem, but before they have all been reported.

    A minimal-ish reproducer is in /etc/wip-fsevents-issue.

    Whatever the reason, sometimes, Darwin seems happy call into
    our event handler with resource after we have left the memory
    space those resources belong to. I consider that a bug somewhere
    in FSEvents, Dispatch or maybe something deeper.

    At one point, I thought that purging events for the device
    would help. Even that fails under sufficiently high load.
    The positive side effect may have effectively been a sleep.
    Sometimes I even consider adding a deliberate  sleep here.
    Because time is not a synchronization primitive, that will
    also eventually fail. Though, if it's the best we can do,
    despite the kernel, maybe it's worth it. I'm not sure.

    Before that, I added a bunch of synchronization primitives
    to the context and made the lifetime of the context a bit
    transactional. We'd check on atomic flags which in the event
    reception loop to be sure we were alive there, after which
    we'd set an idle flag which the `watch` function would wait
    on before cleaning up. All well and good, but then again,
    it's not like any of that memory *even exists* when Darwin
    calls into it after we've asked it to stop and left.

    There's a minimal-ish reproducer in /etc/wip-fsevents-issue.

    "Worse is better."

    2.
    We want to handle any outstanding events before closing,
    so we flush the event stream before stopping it.
    `FSEventStreamInvalidate()` only needs to be called
    if we scheduled via `FSEventStreamScheduleWithRunLoop()`.
    That scheduling function is deprecated (as of macOS 13).
    Calling `FSEventStreamInvalidate()` fails an assertion
    and produces a warning in the console. However, calling
    `FSEventStreamRelease()` without first invalidating via
    `FSEventStreamInvalidate()` also fails an assertion and
    produces a warning. Releasing seems safer than not, so
    we'll do that.
