# Contributions

1. Fork this repository.
2. Checkout the `next` branch.
3. Make commits in the form `topic/subtopic: note`, for example: `adapter/linux: syntax`.
4. If you've made changes to the headers, run `tool/format && tool/hone --header-content-amalgam > sinclude/watcher/watcher.hpp`. This will format the code and create a single-header library for you.
5. Push your changes and create a pull request.

Thank you.
